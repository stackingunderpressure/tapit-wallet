// would be another. Per D-06 the substrate is swappable and never a
// hard dependency; per D-11a Nostr is the default.
//
// One Transport instance represents a connection to a set of relays.
// publish broadcasts an event to all of them; subscribe asks all of
// them for matching events and merges the streams. Implementations
// must dedupe by event id so the same event arriving on multiple
// relays delivers once.
