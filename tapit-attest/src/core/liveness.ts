/**
 * Liveness — the green / no-report / red primitive that the "green ladder"
 * rests on. The security idea is deliberately inverted from a status flag you
 * store and trust: GREEN is never stored anywhere. Green is the DEFAULT a
 * verifier derives at evaluation time from two — and only two — kinds of
 * SIGNED attestation, against a freshness window the verifier itself chooses.
 *
 * 1. Proof-of-life (a heartbeat). The SUBJECT signs "I am alive" over a
 *    domain-separated digest of `{ v, kind:'proof-of-life', subject, issuedAt }`.
 *    Nobody but the subject can mint it (the signature is over the subject's
 *    own x-only key). Whether it counts as "green" is not baked into the
 *    attestation — the verifier passes a `ttlSeconds` and a `now`, and a
 *    heartbeat older than the window simply stops counting. Freshness lives
 *    with the verifier, not the signer, so a stale heartbeat can never be
 *    replayed forward into looking current.
 *
 * 2. Duress / red flag. A PEER signs "I am raising red on subject" over
 *    `{ v, kind:'duress-flag', subject, raisedBy, issuedAt }`. `raisedBy` is
 *    the peer's own x-only key (it always equals the signer). `raisedBy` MAY
 *    equal `subject` — that is self-duress, a person flipping their own state
 *    red under coercion. Red dominates everything: a single verifying red flag
 *    from a member of the subject's chosen group forces 'red' even atop a
 *    fresh, valid heartbeat.
 *
 * The no-rogue rule. Only the subject's CHOSEN people can flip them red. A red
 * flag whose `raisedBy` is not in the group passed to the tally is ignored
 * entirely — an attacker who is not on your list cannot make you look
 * compromised. This is the whole point of taking the group as an explicit
 * argument rather than trusting whoever signed.
 *
 * Red-flag expiry choice. Reds PERSIST. There is no automatic TTL on a duress
 * flag; once a chosen peer raises red it holds until every OTHER member of
 * the subject's group has cast a verifying `DuressClear` vote naming that
 * exact flag (see `DuressClear` below and the tally logic in
 * `livenessStateFor`). The conservative reading wins here: an alarm that
 * silently times itself out is worse than one that holds until a human
 * clears it, and an alarm that ONE person (least of all the flagged subject
 * themselves) can silently lift is almost as bad as no alarm at all.
 *
 * Like the sign-in module, this does no anchoring and no storage. Every
 * function is pure; `now` is injectable; nothing reaches the network. The key
 * never leaves the caller — the `*DigestFor` helpers exist precisely so the
 * Wallet object can sign through its own `signDigest` boundary without ever
 * exposing the raw key.
